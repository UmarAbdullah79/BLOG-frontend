# Blog API project

A full-stack blog application that allows users to **create**, **edit**, and **delete** blog posts. This project demonstrates the use of **RESTful APIs**, dynamic frontend rendering with **EJS**, and server-side logic using **Express.js**.

## How it works

- The frontend uses EJS to render dynamic content based on the backend data.

- The backend exposes RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD operations for blog posts.

- Axios is used to send PATCH and DELETE requests from the frontend.

- Validation is done to prevent empty submissions.

## What I Learned

- Structuring RESTful routes (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)

- Handling form validation both on the client and server side

- Working with axios for API requests

- Rendering dynamic content with EJS

## Future Improvements

- Add database support (MongoDB or PostgreSQL)

- Add user login/authentication

- Add pagination and search functionality
